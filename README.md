### Full Stack Web Application Framework  - Being Refactored as Typescript

Balek is a work-in-progress full-stack web application framework for developing, building, and deploying web applications with remote instances that persist separately from their interfaces. 

The previous version of Balek was written in JavaScript using the Dojo Toolkit. I am refactoring and modernizing the framework to make it more usable and complete. This repository reflects the transitional progress to TypeScript, updated documentation and tests. 


Once refactored, Balek will provide a TypeScript framework for building web applications with built-in modules for login, user, session, and workspace management.
